# grep() searches for matches to the argument pattern within 
# each element of a character vector
# grep(pattern: the pattern to identify, x: the object with the text data)

# gsub() performs replacement of the first and all matches respectively
# gsub(pattern: the pattern to identify,
# replacement: the replacement for matched pattern)/

# Problem Statement:
# Consider the given vector named "InfyDCs". With the help of regex functions, perform the following.

# Extract and display the state-index of the DCs in Karnataka (i.e. KA).

# Replace the abbreviated state name "KA" with "Karnataka".

# Extract and display the state-index values of DCs whose names start with "M" or "m" (i.e. case insensitive search should be done).

# Extract and display the state-index values of DCs whose names do not start with "M" or "m" (i.e.case insensitive search should be done ).

# InfyDCs <- c("Mangalore-KA","McityChennai-TN","SholsChennai-TN","Pune-MH","mysore-KA","Trivandrum-KL","Bangalore-KA","Hyderabad-TS")
